Keras Transformer Model
This repository contains a Keras implementation of a Transformer model, which can be trained on various text data for tasks such as language translation, text generation, and more. The model architecture is based on the Transformer architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
